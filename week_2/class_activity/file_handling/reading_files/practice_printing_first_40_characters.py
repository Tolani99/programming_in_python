To print only the first 40 characters

with open('create_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read(40))
"""
The modified code snippet opens a file named "create_file.txt" in read mode ('r') and reads the first 40 characters of its content. It then prints those 40 characters.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The open() function is used to open the file named "create_file.txt" in read mode ('r').

The with statement is used to ensure the file is properly closed after it's no longer needed.

Inside the with block, file.read(40) is called. The read() method is given an argument of 40, which specifies that it should read up to the first 40 characters from the file.

The print() function is used to display the 40 characters read from the file.

So, when you run this code, it will read the first 40 characters of the file "create_file.txt" (assuming the file exists and has at least 40 characters), and then it will print those characters on the console.
