Fixtures
Fixtures are a type of function that is applied to functions to be tested. These functions must run before that test is executed. The purpose of fixtures is to supply data from multiple sources including URLs and databases to the test before running the test. Fixtures are used in cases where code repeats initialization.

Format:

@pytest.fixture 

Markers
Markers are used to 'mark' specific functions to be executed by letting users create special names. There are many built-in markers such as xfail, xpass, skip and so on.

They follow a format such as:

@pytest.mark.<markername> 

For example:

@pytest.mark.alpha 

Running the specific marked test in the command line can be done with the following command:

pytest -m <markername> -v 

Which will be as follows for a marker called alpha.

pytest -m alpha -v
