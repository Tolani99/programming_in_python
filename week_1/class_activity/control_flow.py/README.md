"For the Light Switch"

The code snippet has a variable called current which keeps track of the state of the light - on or off. The first if statement will check if the light is on and if it is, the flow will go inside the condition and set the current variable to False - turning the light off. In the above code snippet, the value of the current variable is initially set to False, so this condition is not met.

The second if statement will check if the light is off and if it is, the flow will go inside the condition and will set the current varaible to True - turning the light on.
